Crawler to download the books that Springer Publishing made available for free, due the pandemic.

The folder containing the books can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FfkF47koIqD8jB8GEUNjxwfo0zFKbG0C?usp=sharing).

**Caveat**: The book "Business Statistics for Competitive Advantage with Excel 2016", by Cynthia Fraser, was no longer available for free at Springer's website. Hence, the .pdf file in the aforementioned folder is corrupted and cannot be opened.
